# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)


## What dev tools do I need?
 Basically you need makefile and [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). Nonetheless, there are other tools that are optional but we highly recommend. To
 get more info, just type
 ```cmd
 make info
 ```

## I want to changes some settings. Can I re-run my cookiecutter?

Yes. The first run produces a ``.cookiecutterrc`` file with the current selection. Just change
the values of the settings and type ``make replay``.

---
## Can I run the cookiecutter against a developement branch?
Yes. For instance, [pull request #93](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/cookiecutter-osparc-service/pull/93) was using ``pcrespov:is3418/dot_osparc_layout``
which is a branch in the forked repo https://github.com/pcrespov/cookiecutter-osparc-service.
In order to play the cookiecutter developed in that branch just
```cmd
cookiecutter gh:pcrespov/cookiecutter-osparc-service -c is3418/dot_osparc_layout
```

## Permission error with docker

```cmd
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: ...  dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied. See 'docker run --help'.
```
Test first
```
docker run hello-world
```
if you get a similar error then probably the problem is that your user is not allowed to run ``docker``. Then follow https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
